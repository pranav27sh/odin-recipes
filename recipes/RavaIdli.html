    <p>How to Make Rava Idli<br>
1- Heat 2 tablespoons oil or ghee in a pan on medium heat. Once hot, add 12 raw cashews and fry them until they turn golden in color. Then remove them from the pan onto a plate.<br>

2- To the same pan now add 1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds and 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds. Let the mustard seeds pop and cumin seeds sizzle. Then add:<br>

generous pinch of hing<br>
1 teaspoon chopped ginger<br>
1 chopped green chili<br>
3- Sauté 30 seconds, then add 1 teaspoon chana dal. Sauté 30 to 40 seconds and then add around 12 curry leaves.<br>

4- Stir and add 1 cup rava/sooji. Mix well so that all the spices are well combined with the rava.<br>

5- Stirring continuously, roast the rava for 5 to 6 minutes until the raw smell goes away and it’s well roasted. Be careful that the rava doesn’t burn so stir constantly while doing so. You can skip this step of roasting if using pre-roasted rava.<br>

6- Remove pan from heat and transfer the roasted rava to a large bowl. Let it cool down. Once it has cooled down, add the following:<br>

1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
2 tablespoons grated carrots<br>
2 tablespoons chopped cilantro<br>
7- Then add 3/4 cup plain yogurt and stir.<br>

8- Add around 1/2 cup water and whisk to make a smooth batter.<br>

9- The consistency of the batter should be like idli batter, not super thick and not thin either.<br>

10- At this point, cover the bowl with a plate and let it rest for 20 minutes.<br>

11- After 20 minutes, remove the plate. The rava would have absorbed the water and become quite thick. Add 3 to 5 tablespoons more water at this point to make a smooth batter. Meanwhile, add 2 to 3 cups in your steamer and put the water to boil. Also grease your idli plates with oil.<br>

12- Add 1 teaspoon ENO (fruit salt).<br>

13- Mix well, you will notice the batter becomes light as soon as you add the eno. You have to steam the batter immediately after adding the eno, so have everything ready (greased idli plates, steamer ready to go) before you add eno.<br>

14- Place 1 fried cashew in each compartment of the idli plates. Now, fill each of them with the prepared batter. Don’t overfill too much as the batter expands during steaming.<br>

15- Place the idli plates in the steamer. Cover and steam on high heat for 10 to 12 minutes.<br>

16- You will know the idlis are done when you insert a knife in one of the idlis and it comes out clean. Remove plates from the steamer, let them sit for 5 minutes and then carefully remove from plates. I like to slide a silicone spatula or one of those cake spatulas underneath to take them put. Enjoy with sambar and chutney!</p>
